## Who are we?

The founders of the STEMM Role Models app - [Kirstie][link_KirstieJane], Amy, Natalia, Erin and Elizabeth - are friends from their time in graduate school at [UC Berkeley][link_ucberkeley]. There's more information about them (and some pictures) in the [MeetTheTeam](MeetTheTeam.md) file.

The development of this app is mentored by the team behind the [Rosalind Franklin Appathon][link_rfappapthon] - a challenge launched in 2015 to find and support the development of new mobile phone apps to empower women in STEMM. The competition is funded by the [Royal Society's Rosalind Franklin award][link_royalsociety_rfaward] which was won in 2014 by the head of Prof [Rachel McKendry][link_rachelmckendry]. Check out her [awesome lecture][link_rachelmckendry_talk] on _Harnessing the power of mobile phones and big data for global health_.

[Kirstie][link_kirstiejane] is an invited member of the inaugural [Open Leaders Cohort][link_openleaderscohort] of the [Mozilla Science Lab][link_mozsci]. They brought together open science advocates from around the world to participate in the first [Working Open Workshop][link_mozwow] in Berlin in February 2016. The [training exercises][link_mozwow] (which are free and easy to reuse) focused on how to build and effectively engage communities so they can work together to develop tools and resources for the greater good.

## What do we need?

You! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in fundraising, app development, user experience design, database maintenance (particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management.

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be **in the database** once it exists.

## Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and I bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here I'm *sure* you can) then please check out our [contributers' guidelines][CONTRIBUTING.md] and our [roadmap][../../issues/1].

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive enviroment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow our [code of conduct][CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] in all interactions both on and offline.

## Thank you

Thank you so much (danke shone! merci beaucoup!) for visiting the project and we do hope that you'll join us on this amazing journey to support women and other under-represented groups in STEMM.
