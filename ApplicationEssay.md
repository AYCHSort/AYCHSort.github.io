# Application Essay

**Summary of new app idea: (max 500 words). You should consider how your app meets the aims of the challenge. How does it empower or support women in STEMM? What about the app is novel - what does it offer that is not already available? What experience/skills do you/your team possess that could help bring the app to life?**

Women are underrepresented as speakers at conferences even when taking into account the lower base rate of women working in STEMM fields [1]. Many explanations have been suggested to explain this paucity; implicit bias likely plays a role, and imposter syndrome may prevent women from applying or promoting themselves, but, more simply, selection committees simply do not know whom to contact outside the “usual suspects”.

The STEMM Role Model app will provide a list of experts who exemplify a diverse representation of people in their field. While it is likely that many of the profiles will be from women, the app is not limited to a focus on gender inequality. Role models may be any combination of female, a person of colour, LGBTQ, a person with a disability, have followed a non-traditional career path, a parent or carer, or any other underrepresented group.

Many men are invited to speak at conferences because they have been invited in the past and the organisers know their presentations will be of interest to the attendees. Users of the STEMM Role Models app will be encouraged to create and update profiles for anyone they want to recommend, and to provide short endorsements. Only a name will be required in order for an expert’s profile to be created (further information can be crowd-sourced by other users) and a verification check mark will indicate which fields have been confirmed by the expert herself. An example is provided in the app’s GitHub repository [2].

What sets the STEMM Role Model app apart from other curated lists of female experts [3,4] is the focus on community support: overcoming the detrimental effects of the imposter complex by raising each other up rather than relying on self-promotion. We do not seek to encourage women to “act more like men” but rather to emphasise the benefits that working together can bring.

All STEMM Role Models app development team members are women who have presented at major conferences in their fields and have extensive experience conducting outreach to encourage girls and women into STEMM fields. Kirstie Whitaker is the lead developer and will switch from coach (Python) to student (app development) at the regular Codebar.io programming workshops she coordinates in Cambridge. Amy Orsborn and Natalia Bilenko have contributed illustrations and interactive visualisations for the Berkeley Science Review and will oversee the app’s design and interactive experience. More information about the team can be found at the project’s GitHub repository [5].

On the surface, the STEMM Role Models app will provide a resource for conference organisers who are committed to overcoming their implicit biases and promoting a diverse representation at their event. But more profoundly, by encouraging the community to support its members it will empower women to overcome the effects of imposter syndrome and thrive in their careers.
