SUBJECT: ***STEMM Role Models development sprint - [DATE] - all welcome***

Dear [appropriate title eg: Cambridge Neuroscientists],

In February of this year my team and I won the runners up prize in the Rosalind Franklin appathon, a national competition to find the best ideas to harness the power of mobile technology to support women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine.

We sought to tackle the problem that women are less likely to be invited to speak at conferences, even when you take into account their lower representation in senior positions as a whole. We know the confidence that young researchers build when they see people "just like them" in leadership roles and we know that increasing diversity can inspire the most creative ideas across all fields of STEMM and at every step along the academic career trajectory.

We proposed a database that conference organisers could use to widen their reach when considering which researchers to invite to speak or to sit on panels. Each profile contains information about the researcher's skills, publications, previous speaking engagements etc, as well as their membership of some of the typically under-represented groups in leadership positions in STEMM: women, people of colour/black minority ethnic, people with a disability, LGBTQ and parent or carer.

Two important aspects set the STEMM Role Models project apart from current tools (such as google!) that can be used to create speaker lists 1) members of the database can be uploaded by anyone (department administrators, prinicipal investigators, funding agencies) thus minimizing the effect of the imposter complex that causes women to promote themselves less than men, and 2) we will curate testimonials from members of the community who have seen the women speak to facilitate conference organisers to build the very best program they can.

We are also dedicated to open source development and providing opportunities for women and other under-represented groups to build their confidence working in an online collaborative environment. We welcome anyone of any level of experience and at any career stage (including our friends outside the ivory tower of academia!) to join us in our adventure to build the website and assocated mobile app.

You can join us at any time at our [GitHub repository](www.github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels). The [README file](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/README.md) gives an overview of the project, the [CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) tells you how you can get involved, and the [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines our rules of engagement (in short, be excellent to each other).

We also have a sprint half day coming up. It will be held on **XXXXXXX** from **2pm to 9pm** in the following three modules. You do not need to attend all of the modules, we're happy to have you take part in whichever you're interested in and that fit best with your schedule:

  * 2:00pm to 4:00pm - **Intro to GitHub and how to contribute to open source projects**. This session is ideal for people who aren't sure how to get started contributing to the project. Please bring your laptop, or be prepared to share with someone when you arrive, and by the end of the session you'll have a GitHub account and will have submitted your first pull request. Kirstie will give an overview presentation of both the STEMM Role Models project and an introduction to git and GitHub, and the leadership team will have created some "good first bugs" that you can complete during this session.

  * 4:30pm to 6:30pm - **Brainstorming ideas and project planning**. This session will focus mostly around pitching ideas about how to develop the database, website and app, and how to implement them. Everyone will work in pairs or small groups to propose an issue that they can work on, and then pitch it to the group. There will then be a round of editing and commenting on the suggestions (on GitHub) and a final pitch to the room. The team members do not need to be able to implement these ideas themselves, rather they will be trying to be as clear as possible to make engaging experts in the field as efficient as possible! (If they are experts in the field that's excellent and hopefully they'll stay to implement their ideas in the final session!)

  * 7:00pm to 9:00pm - **Implementing the suggestions**. In the final two hours, we'll be joined by developers from industry who will be able to help implement the technical ideas that have been proposed in the previous session. This is an ideal cumulation of the day and we're very excited to have some real deliverables to take home!


There will be food and drinks available courtesy of our sponsors [WHOT WE DON'T HAVE YET] including vegetarian and gluten-free options (please let us know of any dietary requirements when you register).

If you have any questions please contact Kirstie at kw401 AT cam DOT ac DOT uk.

Thank you for reading all this way, and we're looking forward to seeing you on XXXXX<-- DATE
