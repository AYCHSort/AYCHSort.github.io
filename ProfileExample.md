## Testimonials

* Kirstie is a dynamica and engaging speaker. She has a clear passion for her work on structural and functional brain changes during childhood and adolescence and how abberent developmental trajectories may underlie the emergence of mental health disorders. Kirstie is an advocate for open science, particularly the importance of reproducible and replicable research. I saw her presentation at the Open Con Cambridge conference (http://www.opencon2015.org/keren/opencon_cambridge) and would highly recommend her as an invited speaker at future events.
