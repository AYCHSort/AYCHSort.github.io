##To-Do

####Mobile todo
* When you've filtered some results, and pop one up, you can still go side to sdie through ALL ofm, should just be the filtered ones.
* Mobile mode sucks when there's a popup, you cant close it and you can't go side to side
* And need to make all the stuff smaller


####Stuff to put in the prototype clean slate
* Localstorage handling, so you dont have to get new data all the time if you dont want to
* URL detecting
* Checking for a parameter in the querystring
