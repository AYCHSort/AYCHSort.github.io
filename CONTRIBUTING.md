## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team (and if you're here you are a member of the STEMM Role Models team). The can be [questions][link_question], [bugs][link_bugs], [requests][link_requests], [applications][link_applications] or a myriad of other suggestions.

### Labels

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab][link_issues].

The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [Question][link_question]: This label highlights all issues that are questions and is a great place to start. Whomever has opened the issue wants to hear from you! 
  * To reply, read the question and then put your opinions in a comment.
  * These opinions can be:
    * a thumbs up (:thumbsup:) if you're loving what you see (check out this [cheat sheet][link_emojis] for other emojis that you might like)
    * a more nuanced description of your answer (using your words)
    * or you could ask for a clarification
  * If you'd like to posit an additional question take a breath and make sure that your question is related (could it be a new issue instead?) and if you're confident you're in the right place, then ask away :smiley:

* [Applications][link_applications]: This label highlights all issues concerning applications.
  * Applications can include suggestions for future applications or a to do list for ongoing applications
  * The label is intentionally broad: applications can be for anything from funding or membership of workshops etc

* [No Code][link_nocode]: This label highlights all issues that don't require any coding knowledge
  * If you're looking to contribute but aren't very confident in your coding skills these issues are a great place to start.
  * All issues with the no code label are asking for feedback or suggestions

* [Help Wanted][link_helpwanted]: This label highlights all issues where a member of the team has determined that we need additional help
  * If you have particular skills these are a great place to offer them
  * If you aren't sure what to offer, you could also recommend issues to your friends/colleagues who may be able to help
  
* [Bugs][link_bugs]: this label highlights all issues that are pointing to problems in the project
  * If you find a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue
  * If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment

* [Requests][link_requests]: this label highlights all issues that are asking for features (or anything else) to be added to the project
  * If you have a good idea and would like to see it implemented in the STEMM Role Models project please open a new issue and add in as much detail as possible
  * Please try to make sure that your feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented. If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other request in your issue
