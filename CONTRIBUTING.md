## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team (and if you're here you are a member of the STEMM Role Models team). The can be **questions**, **bugs**, **feature requests**, **applications** or a myriad of other **suggestions**.

### Labels

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab][link_issues]. The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [Question][link_question]: This label highlights all issues that are questions and is a great place to start. Whomever has opened the issue wants to hear from you! 
  * To reply, read the question and then put your opinions in a comment.
  * These opinions can be:
    * a thumbs up (:thumbsup:) if you're loving what you see (check out this [cheat sheet][link_emojis] for other emojis that you might like)
    * a more nuanced description of your answer (using your words)
    * or you could ask for a clarification
  * If you'd like to posit an additional question take a breath and make sure that your question is related (could it be a new issue instead?) and if you're confident you're in the right place, then ask away :smiley:
* [Applications][link_applications]: All issues concerning applications. These can include suggestions for future applications or a to do list for ongoing applications. The label is pretty broad: applications can be for anything from funding or membership of workshops etc.
