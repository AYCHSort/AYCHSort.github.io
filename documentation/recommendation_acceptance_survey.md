# STEMM Role Model Recommendation Acceptance Survey

These are the questions included in the google form that collects information for the database: https://goo.gl/forms/rvA9nKv32vQvjknh1

## Introduction

Congratulations! Someone thinks you are a valuable role model in STEMM, and has recommended you to be member of the STEMM Role Models database!

The goal of the STEMM Role Models project is to ensure that conference organizers are inviting the most exciting speakers to their events rather than just relying on the "same old faces". We want to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, software developers, mathematicians and clinicians by making sure they see people just like you being celebrated for your work.

We want to combat the fact that women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, people living with a disability, people for whom English is not their first language, people with caring responsibilities, and people who have taken a non-traditional career path are less likely to be invited speakers at events.

In the next few pages you'll be asked to fill in some information about yourself, your work and whether you identify as one or more of the groups described above. Once you have completed the form (and after a quick human moderation step to make sure you haven't filled in the form with rude words!) the information will be added to our website and event organizers will be able to find out, really easily, how cool you are and what an asset to their event you'd be.

Please note: we don't display any recommendations -- or information about role models -- without their consent. You don't have to fill in any of the information shown below and you don't have to identify as any of the demographic groups we have described.

If you are interested in being listed as a STEMM role model, please continue to the next page.

## Section 1: The basics

Just to get us warmed up, please complete the following questions.
Remember that you can skip any you don't want to answer.

* What is your first name?
* What is your last name?
* What is your title? (Prof, Dr, Ms, etc)
* What is your job title?
* Where do you work?
* In which city do you live?
* In which country do you live?
* Please include a link to a photograph of you

## Section 2: Your expertise

Here are a few questions about your research or work expertise. Please enter keywords that are likely to be searched by event organizers looking for speakers just like you.

* What is your main research area or specialty?
* Are there any sub-specialties you would like to list?>
* Are you expert in anything else that you'd like to include?

## Section 3: Links to pages about you

We've heard from conference organizers that one of the biggest reasons they invite the "same old crowd" to speak at their events is that they know how well they engage with the audience.

This page is your opportunity to share any links to more information about yourself to help those organizers make their decision!

* Please add here links to YouTube (or the video sharing site of your choice) clips of presentations you have given
* Please add here links to professional web pages that you would like to share (such as LinkedIn, Research Gate etc)
* Please add here links to data or code you would like to share (eg: GitHub or Figshare repositories)
* Please add here links to social media pages you would like to share (eg: your twitter page, your personal blog)

## Section 4: Role model identification

We ask this question because we would like to encourage conference organizers to make equity and inclusion a priority, and we want to facilitate their good intentions by allowing them to search for members of traditionally under-represented groups.

You can identify with as many of these demographics as you would like.

But this is not a deposition. Please feel free to not answer any questions that you do not want to become public knowledge on the internet.

Would you like to be publicly identified as:

* A woman
* A person of color
* A member of the lesbian / gay / bisexual / transgendered / queer community
* Someone who is differently-abled
* Someone with caring responsibilities (for example for children or elderly parents)
* Someone who has taken a non-traditional career path
* Someone for whom English is not a first language
* Other: 

## Section 5: Approval

This is the only mandatory question. We don't want to make any information about yourself available that you don't want to share on the STEMM Role Models website.

We'll take down your information at any point in the future if you wish to be removed from the database, but please keep in mind that once information is indexed by search engines, it can very difficult to remove from the realm of public data.

Do you approve of being listed as a potential speaker on our website, with all of the information that you included above?

* Approved
* Declined
