# How the STEMM Role Models Database works

## Recommend someone

You can complete [this google form](https://goo.gl/forms/wkLVdTvg758u61yR2) to recommend someone is added to the database.

On receiving the information we email them the...

## Acceptance survey

This is a [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/rvA9nKv32vQvjknh1) that collects information for the database.

You can see the questions in the [recommendation_acceptance_survey.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/gh-pages/documentation/recommendation_acceptance_survey.md) in the [documentation folder](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/tree/gh-pages/documentation) of this repository.

## Testimonial survey

The third [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/IEoWkzY0ytHoKE2r1) collects recommender's testimonials in support of the role models in the database.

## Manual moderation

We check that the role model has confirmed that she is willing to be listed in the database and then copy across the information she has provided along with any testimonials into the public datasheet.

## Public datasheet

This is a google spreadsheet that is [published to the web](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/37579?hl=en) which means it can easily be accessed if you know the sheet ID.

Only data that has been approved by the role model and the recommenders will be available on this sheet. No email addresses are included.

## Refresh the database!

They should be there! Yaaaaay for our STEMM Role Models :tada:
