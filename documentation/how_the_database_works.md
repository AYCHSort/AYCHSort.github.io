# How the STEMM Role Models Database works

## Recommend someone

You can complete [this google form](https://goo.gl/forms/wkLVdTvg758u61yR2) to recommend someone is added to the database.

On receiving the information we email them the...

## Acceptance survey

This is a [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/rvA9nKv32vQvjknh1) that collects information for the database.

You can see the questions in the [recommendation_acceptance_survey.md](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/gh-pages/documentation/recommendation_acceptance_survey.md) in the [documentation folder](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/tree/gh-pages/documentation) of this repository.

## Manual moderation

We check that the role model has confirmed that she is willing to be listed in the database and then copy across the answers from the form into the public datasheet.

## Refresh the database!

They should be there! Yaaaaay for our STEMM Role Models :tada:
