I've always wanted to understand the world, and my study of brain development during childhood and adolescence allows me to answer questions about how the biology underpinning all the complexities of the human mind. I've met challenges along the way - particularly with respect to my experiences as a young woman in science - and I have been surprised at the misogyny and sexism that I have have encountered in my day to day work. I am in the early stages of developing a mobile app to address the problem that women in STEMM (Science, Techonology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine) are less likely to be invited to speak at conferences. Our solution is to provide a searchable database of women in all areas of STEMM with testimonials to ensure that event organisers have confidence that speakers they may not have heard present before come highly recommended. The STEMM Role Models app was runner up in the Rosalind Franklin appathon in February 2016, and I would greatly benefit from the opportunity to learn from women techmakers, get feedback on my ideas and hopefully build some productive collaborations at this event. More details of the app are available at our GitHub repository: www.github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels.
