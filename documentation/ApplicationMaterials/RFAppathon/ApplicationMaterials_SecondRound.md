### Please describe the problem that your app is solving and how your app proposes to solve it. 

Women are underrepresented in STEMM fields, particularly at senior levels in academia. A key to career advancement for early career researchers is attending and presenting at professional conferences. Even taking into account the relative paucity of female researchers to invite, women are less likely to be invited to speak at these events. Often invitations are based on the organisers’ professional and social circles, and it can be difficult to expand these networks to include a diverse array of qualified academics whom one does not know personally. The STEMM Role Models app will allow conference organisers to search, by field of study and customisable key words, a crowd-sourced database of STEMM academics from diverse backgrounds. By making it easier to ensure there are diverse and representative panels in future academic meetings, we will break the cycle of inviting “the same old crowd” every year and support the career development of young women in all areas of STEMM.

### Specifically, how does your app empower women in STEMM?

When conference organisers use the STEMM Role Models app to ensure the invited speakers are representative of their fields gender balance, they are increasing the visibility of women researchers to their peers and to the public. By speaking at conferences women are more likely to receive recognition of their accomplishments, create networks and foster new collaborations. Beyond the benefits to the speakers themselves we will increase the visibility of female role models for young women and girls. This powerful and inspiring effect will be supported by the fact that anyone can add testimonials to a woman’s profiles in the STEMM Role Models app. By working together to promote excellent research undertaken by women from a diverse range of backgrounds we will empower women and girls looking for examples of people “just like themselves” who have excelled as leaders in STEMM research.

### Where did the idea come from? 

When team member Dr Erin Rich pledged that the invited speakers for a symposium she was organising would be gender balanced she did not imagine how hard finding appropriate female speakers would be. Looking back over the years of conference presentations that she had attended only served up more examples of male researchers in her field. Ultimately Dr Rich spent many hours emailing these men asking them to recommend female colleagues. Her hard work paid off, but on hearing her story the other team members were motivated to make this struggle a thing of the past. The STEMM Role Models app development team is composed of academic women in STEMM fields, who have personally noted the secondary role women often play as invited speakers at professional conferences. We also know how much work early career academics have to manage and wanted to ensure that anyone who wants to do the right thing, has the tools that allow them to do so freely available when they need them.

### What made you want to apply to this competition?

It can be very demoralising working as a female early career researcher in STEMM fields. It can be difficult to see your own career path when surrounded by the status quo of white, male academics. In many cases the inertia of the academic system is particularly damaging: it is not enough to simply see that there is a problem, someone must act to change it. Each member of the app development team has experienced the power that a positive role model can play - including Rosalind Franklin herself - and have been that role model for junior colleagues. We have witnessed the inequalities in the current system and are dedicated to changing the entrenched biases within it. We are confident that the existence of a list of STEMM role models will be an inspiration to many in our shoes and those who are on the same career trajectories. The support of such high profile sponsors as the Royal Society and University College London makes the project’s success even more likely.

### If you were to win the cash prize, what would you spend the money on?

We would invest the cash prize into user testing. We are committed to ensuring that our app is easy to use as we must ensure that the crowd-sourced database is easy to maintain and grow and that our search terms are intuitive and accessible. The prize would be split into 50 prizes of £20 each in order to reimburse our user experience testers for their time and feedback.
