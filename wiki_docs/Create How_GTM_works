What Google Tag Manager is and why it's an easy tool?
Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a tool that allows you to to add tracking tags to your website or app. Contributors, such as marketers, traders can help track data on your site without having to add any hard code to your code base

A tracking tag is snippet of code which enables you to collect data about your users, such as how many times they view a website page or how many times they click on a button. GTM connects with third party services like Google Analytics and Google AdWords, making it easy to send your data to different tools.
It provides flexibility to user to add or manage the AdWords, Google analytics, Flood-light and non-Google tags using the GTM.

How it works
  Followings are main components of the GTM:
  1. Account
  2. Container
  3. Tags
  4. Triggers
  5. Variables
  6. Folders

Account
An account is where you will hold all of the containers for tracking tags. A company or organization/institution has an account, which can hold GTM for multiple sites or apps associated with it.
Each account can contains multiple containers
  
Container
A container includes the tracking tags (e.g. Google Analytics, AdWords Conversion Tracking tags) that you want to use on the website.
  One website should have one container. If comapany or organization having a dev or staging environment for their website, they should have a separate container for those URLs.

Tags
Tags are snippets of code on your site that collect data
  A tag must have at least one rule in order to fire
