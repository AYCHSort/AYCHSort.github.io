<p>Thank you for visiting the STEMM Role Models app project repository.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-are-we-doing" class="anchor" href="#what-are-we-doing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are we doing?</h2>

<h3>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The problem</h3>

<ul>
<li>Women and other minorities are less likely to be invited to speak at academic and tech conferences</li>
<li>Women are less likely to promote themselves: they are more likely to suffer from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a>
</li>
<li>It's difficult for conference organisers to know how good an invited speaker will be if they haven't seen them present before</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if even the very best intentioned conference organisers (who know the powerful and supportive effects that seeing a diverse panel of presenters have for under-represented groups) have mostly seen presentations by (straight, white, cis-gendered) men then they're likely to invite men again. And so the cycle continues.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-solution" class="anchor" href="#the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The solution</h3>

<p>The STEMM Role Models app will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve visibility for researchers and developers by making a database that is easy to search with customizable keywords</li>
<li>Allow anyone to add researchers so the database can grow without relying on women promoting themselves</li>
<li>Provide information that is useful for making decisions on key note invitations such as links to blogs, social media, journal articles, youtube clips, a list of previous invited presentations and testimonals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone in the database will have the opportunity to identify themselves as one or more of a selection of different under-represented groups in STEMM. The goal is to ensure that <strong><em>conference organisers are able to access a diverse and representative group of the most exciting researchers in their field from around the world</em></strong>.</p>

<a id="who-are-we" class="anchor" href="#who-are-we" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who are we?</h2>

<p>The founders of the STEMM Role Models app - <a href="https://github.com/KirstieJane">Kirstie</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neuroAmyo">Amy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/erich001">Erin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/elizabethjm">Elizabeth</a> - are friends from their time in graduate school at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. There's more information about them (and some pictures) in the <a href="MeetTheTeam.md">MeetTheTeam</a> file.</p>

<p>The development of this app is mentored by the team behind the <a href="http://www.rfappathon.org/">Rosalind Franklin Appathon</a> - a challenge launched in 2015 to find and support the development of new mobile phone apps to empower women in STEMM. The competition is funded by the <a href="https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/rosalind-franklin-award/">Royal Society's Rosalind Franklin award</a> which was won in 2014 by the Prof <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/tb/people/steering-group/rachel-mckendry">Rachel McKendry</a>. Check out her <a href="https://royalsociety.org/events/2014/11/rosalind-franklin-lecture/">awesome lecture</a> on <em>Harnessing the power of mobile phones and big data for global health</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/KirstieJane">Kirstie</a> is an invited member of the inaugural <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/wow-introducing-working-open-workshops-and-the-open-leaders-cohort">Open Leaders Cohort</a> of the <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/about">Mozilla Science Lab</a> who brought together open science advocates from around the world to participate in the first <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/index.html">Working Open Workshop</a> in Berlin in February 2016. The <a href="http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/index.html">training exercises</a> (which are free and easy to reuse) focused on how to build and effectively engage communities so they can work together to develop tools and resources for the greater good.</p>

<a id="what-do-we-need" class="anchor" href="#what-do-we-need" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do we need?</h2>

<p><strong>You</strong>! In whatever way you can help.</p>

<p>We need expertise in fundraising, app development, user experience design, database maintenance (particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management.</p>

<p>We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be <strong>in the database</strong> once it exists.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to support women in STEMM and while the app is aimed at conference organisers, we're excited to plug another hole in the leaky pipeline by supporting the professional development of any and all of our contributers. If you're looking to learn to code, try out working collaboratively, get some experience writing grant applications or translate you skills to the digital domain, we're here to help.</p>
